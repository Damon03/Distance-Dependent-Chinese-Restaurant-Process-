# Distance-Dependent-Chinese-Restaurant-Process-

Repository for running ddcrp clustering using embedding based distance on a text corpus. 

Just added a ipython notebook by combining different files from Rishabh Mehrotra's repo:

https://github.com/rishabhmehrotra/ddcrp_subtasks

1) Run ddCRP data generation.ipynb 

2) Then go to ddcrp R folder and run 'Rscript data-modeling.R'

3) You will get results in cluster.txt.
